This C program implements a Bus Reservation System that allows users to add buses, book seats, cancel reservations, and view bus details. 
It supports up to 10 buses, each having 32 seats. The data is stored in a binary file (buses.dat) to retain information across sessions. 
The program ensures safe input handling using scanf and fgets, preventing buffer overflows. 
It includes file operations for saving/loading data and provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
